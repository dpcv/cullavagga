# Notes on the DPCV

## The manuscript’s English description

One folio has English writing. It says:

> 144 leaves 23" x 2 1/4"
>
> Purchased for Rs 1000₹ along with other 38 ola mss from late Mr. H.C.P. Bell’s estate on 12.1.1938.

At the left of the leaf it says 69/LI.

The amount of Rs 1000 seems like quite a lot. According to [Saurabh Chandra](https://zeenews.india.com/business/news/finance/the-fallacy-of-dollar-rupee-in-1947_82327.html), the exchange rate in this period was £1:₹13.33. That means the manuscript was purchased for £75. According to [this site](https://www.paper-dragon.com/1939/exchange.html) the exchange rate with the USD was 2.73, which gives $366 USD. When adjusted for inflation, this would be over $6300 in 2019. At the time, this would be about half the price of a new Pontiac.

[Mr. H.C.P. Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Charles_Purvis_Bell) was the first Commissioner of Archaeology in Ceylon. I am not aware that anything is known about the manuscript between its origin in the 13th century and its appearance in Mr. Bell’s estate following his death in 1937. In conversation with a senior civil servant in Sri Lanka in 2018, he told me that when travelling the country he would drop by antique and other interesting stores, and if there was an interesting manuscript he would purchase it. Perhaps the DPCV was acquired by Mr. Bell in a similar fashion.
