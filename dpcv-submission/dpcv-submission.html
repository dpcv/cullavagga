<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
<p class="re">Re: Imaging and transcribing the Dutiya Par훮kkamab훮hu Cullavagga manuscript.</p>
<p>One of the masterpieces held in the National Museum of Colombo is a 13th century manuscript of the Pali Cullavagga. It is the oldest identified manuscript in Sri Lanka, and probably the oldest complete Pali manuscript in the world. Due to the great value of this item, the text should be preserved and made available for Pali scholars. With this letter the undersigned propose the establishing of a project to image and transcribe the manuscript.</p>
<p>In recent years, Pali scholars internationally have shown an increasing interest in the manuscript tradition. Most published Pali texts are based on manuscripts that are no more than a century or two old. While we believe that these are reliable witnesses for a much earlier textual tradition, it is important to establish this as firmly as possible.</p>
<p>The Dutiya Par훮kkamab훮hu Cullavagga manuscript is five centuries older than most published sources, but remains in exceptionally good condition despite its great antiquity. It is one of the few surviving Pali manuscripts that pre-dates the re-importing of manuscripts from Burma and Thailand in the 18th century.</p>
<p>Here is an initial proposal for the scope of the project. These details are subject to the careful assessment of the state of the manuscript by experts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Photograph the manuscript in high-resolution images.</li>
<li>Engage an epigraphic expert to assess the script.</li>
<li>Carbon date the manuscript.</li>
<li>Type and carefully proofread the manuscript.</li>
<li>Publish digitally and in print.</li>
<li>The text, as well as accompanying artwork and historical context, should be described in appropriate international journals.</li>
</ul>
<p>The manuscript is the property of the Department of Archaeology, and is currently on display in the National Museum of Colombo. We seek your permission to undertake this project. It will be a collaboration between the following bodies:</p>
<ul>
<li>National Museum of Colombo</li>
<li>Department of Archaeology</li>
<li>University of Sri Jayewardenepura</li>
<li>SuttaCentral</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we will collaborate with other national or international bodies as appropriate.</p>
<p>Should there be any questions, please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned.</p>
<p>Yours with respect,</p>
